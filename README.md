# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes prediction with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Achieved the highest accuracy among literature

Diabetes Mellitus is a dangerous chronic disease
that develops when blood sugar levels remain high for an
extended period of time. Diabetics are at a higher risk of ailments
such as heart and kidney disease, stroke, and vision issues, among
others. Diabetes prediction was chosen for this article because
it affects a large number of individuals. This prediction was
made using a variety of machine learning methods, including
decision trees, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and Ensemble. The data
was preprocessed with a range of EDA approaches before being
used with these algorithms. The approaches described in this
project can be utilized for pre-diagnosis, saving time and effort
for doctors. The widely used PIMA Indian Dataset was used for
this articleâ€™s dataset. The patients have eight different qualities
in this dataset
